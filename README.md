# Psychairefatback
An interpreter for the esoteric programming language of the same name.

The interpreter should be able to 1) interpret and execute all 16 instructions in the language, 2) display all 4 data layers as 16 by 16 grids, with each layer's data represented differently, and 3) be able to run on Linux, Windows, and possibly Mac.

I'll be working in the Wiki section of this repository to add documentation for the language. Have fun with Psychairefatback!
